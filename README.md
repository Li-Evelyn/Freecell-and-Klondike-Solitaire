# Freecell-and-Klondike-Solitaire
This program is a combination of two one-player card games (Freecell Solitaire and Klondike Solitaire).
It was written in Turing for a 12th grade Computer Science project.
The original title screen background was removed due to identifying information. It has since been replaced by a more aesthetically-pleasing and grammatically correct version of itself.

Original program by Evelyn Li and Terry Feng
