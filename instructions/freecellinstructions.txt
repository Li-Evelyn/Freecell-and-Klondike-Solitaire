Freecell Instructions

Goal: To create four stacks of cards (one per suit) in the foundation in the upper-right corner.

How to Play:

Valid moves are as follows.

1. Move cards from one column to another. 
Cards must be placed in descending order (by number) and alternate between red and black (diamond/heart and club/spade).

2. Move a card to a free cell. 
These four cells are located in the upper-left corner and can temporarily hold any single card during play.

3. Move cards to the foundation. Cards must be the correct suit and number. Foundations fill up in order from Ace to King.

4. Move a stack of cards. 
A valid stack contains cards in descending order and alternating colours (see criteria in 1.). 
Moving stacks in freecell is equivilant to moving one card to each of the free cells and then back to the board. 
As such, you can only move as many cards as you have open cells 
(mathematically, where n is the number of free cells, you may move a stack with cards of up to n + 1). 
For this purpose, empty columns count as free cells.

5. Move cards to empty cells. You may move single cards or stacks as long as the free cell rule holds.

Game End: When all four foundations have thirteen cards in them as per the criteria in 3.
